10.	Using a doâ€¦while loop write a program that calculates the sum of integers input by a user. The program should allow the user to enter as many numbers as possible, until the user enters 0. (4 marks) 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Sum {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        int sum = 0;
        int num;

        do {
            System.out.print("Enter an integer (enter 0 to stop): ");
            num = input.nextInt();
            sum += num;
        } while (num != 0);

        System.out.println("The sum of the entered integers is: " + sum);
    }
}
