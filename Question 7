7.	Using a for loop write a program to compute the sum of numbers between 20 and 25. (3 marks) 
public class Sum{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int start = 20;
        int end = 25;
        int sum = 0;

        for (int num = start; num <= end; num++) {
            sum += num;
        }

        System.out.println("The sum of numbers between " + start + " and " + end + " is: " + sum);
    }
}
