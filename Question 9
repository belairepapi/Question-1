public class Sum{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int start = 20;
        int end = 25;
        int sum = 0;
        int num = start;

            do {
            sum += num;
            num++;
        } while (num <= end);

        System.out.println("The sum of numbers between " + start + " and " + end + " is: " + sum);
    }
}
